# Given a scenario, use the appropriate tool to assess organizational security

## Reconnaissance Tools Part 1
**Traceroute** - determines route a packet takes to a destination   
- `tracert` for Windows and `traceroute` for Unix-based
- Uses TTL field on ICMP packets to map routes
- Flavors:
	- Windows - uses ICMP echo requests
		- This may be bad because firewalls often block ICMP
	- Unix-based - allow you to specify protocol

**nslookup** and **dig**    
- `nslookup` - in Windows and POSIX-based, used to look up name and IPs; this is no deprecated (use dig instead)
- `dig` - Domain Information Groper - does everything nslookup can do but provides a lot more information. 

**ipconfig** and **ifconfig**   
- You know these

**ping**    
- `ping` - uses ICMP to troubleshoot network connection issues
- `pathping` - Windows uses traceroute and ping to provide the information from both

**netstat** - used to gather network statistics    
- `netstat -a` - shows all active connections
- `netstat -b `- Windows option for showing binaries
- `netstat -n` - Does not resolve names

**Address Resolution Protocol**    
- `arp -a` - shows arp cache (Linux and Windows)

**route** - show active routes you're communicating with
- `route print` - Windows 
- `netstat -r` - Unix


## Part 2
**curl** - Client URL    
- grabs raw data and displays in the terminal

**IP scanners** - search network for IP addresses   
- Can use ARP, ICMP, TCP ACK, etc.
- **hping** - ping but on steroids, kinda like Nmap
	- e.g. `hping --destport 80 10.1.10.1`
	- Make sure you don't accidentally DDoS your network
- **Nmap** - network mapper
	- OS scan, scripts, service scan, etc.

**theHarvester**    
- Gather OSINT
- Scrape information from Google, Bing, Linkedin, etc.
- Provides DNS brute force

**sn1per**   
- Combines many recon tools into a single framework (nmap, metasploit, theHarvester, etc)

**scanless** - runs port scans from a different host/proxy    
**dnsenum** - enumerate DNS information     
- `dnsenum -v example.com`

**Nessus** - Industry leader in vulnerability scanning and remediating.    
- Extensive support 
- Free and commercial options

**Cuckoo** - A sandbox for malware with extensive capabilities     


## File Manipulation Tools
- cat - concatenate
- head - cat the head of a file
- tail - cat the end of a file
- grep - find a pattern in a file
- chmod - change permissions
- **logger** - add entries to the syslog
	- e.g. `logger "This information is added to syslog"`


## Shell and Script Environments
**SSH (Secure Shell)** - Encrypted remote terminal over tcp/22      
**Windows PowerShell** - Command line for sysadmins    
- Scripts have .ps1 extension
- Extend command-line functions
	- Uses cmdlet (command-lets)

**Python** - general-purpose scripting language    
**OpenSSL** - toolkit and crypto library for SSL/TLS    
- Build and manage SSL/TLS certificates
- Create X.509 certificates
- Manage CSRs and CRLs


## Packet Tools
**Wireshark** - GUI packet analyzer    
**tcpdump** - CLI packet analyzer    
**Tcpreplay** - a suite of packet replay utilities    
- Tests security devices to see if they detect and/or prevent the network traffic


## Forensic Tools
**dd** - Data Definition - uses to create bit-by-bit copy of a drive    
- e.g. `dd if=/dev/sda of=/tmp/sda-image.img`
**memdump** - copy information in system memory to the standard output stream

**WinHex** - a hexadecimal editor with Windows OS.     
- Also prvides secure wipes, disk cloning, editing disk, files and RAM, and much more.

**FTK imager** - drive imaging tool, very versatile    
**Autopsy** - forensic tool from images, viewing everything on the drive    
**Exploitation frameworks** - pre-built toolkit for exploitation for custom attacks   
- Metaploit, Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET)

**Password crackers**   
- Hashcat, john, etc.

**Data sanitization**   
- Completely removing (sanitizing) data
