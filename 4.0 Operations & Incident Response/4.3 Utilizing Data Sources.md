# Given an incident, utilize appropriate data sources to support an investigation

## Vulnerability Scan Output
**Identify vulnerability** - Scanners look for signitures of vulnerabilities.   
- Vulnerabilities can also be cross-referenced
	- National Vulnerability Database (NVD)
	- MS Security Bulletins

**Scan results**  
- Lack of security controls (No firewall, anti-virus, etc)
- Misconfigurations (open shares, guest access)
- Real vulnerabilities (like Log4j, Policykit, etc)

**Dealing with false positives** - Different then low severity vulnerabilities, these vulnerabilities don't exits.    
**False negative** - When you have a vulnerability but did not detect it. To mitigate false positives or negatives, keep your signatures updated.


## SIEM Dashboards
**SIEM** - Security Information and Event Management   
- Security alerts using logging with real-time information
- Also allows data correlation and forensic analysis

- **Sensors and logs** - logs such as syslogs and sensors such as NetFlow.    
- **Sensitivity** - ability to parse data into categories ranging in sensitivity.    
- **Trends** - id changes and easily view attack metrics.   
- **Alerts** - id security event and visualize the log info and raw data.
- **Correlation** - combining and comparing data.


## Log Files
**Network logs** - Switches, routes, etc. logs that log network changes, routing updates, authentication issues, etc. This depends on the logs device.   

**System logs** - OS information, file system, authentication details. There is a lot of data in syslogs, this may require filtering.   

**Application logs** - Specific to application. Parse the log details in the SIEM
- Windows: `Event Viewer / Application Log`
- Linux: `/var/log`

**Security logs** - Detailed security-related information including allowed/blocked traffic, exploit attempts, DNS sinkhole traffic, etc. These logs are created on IPS, firewalls, and proxies. This information is critical.    

**Firewall logs** - Shows traffic that is blocked and allowed. A WAF provides more information in there logs.     

**Web log files** - Web server errors, access, exploit attempts, and server activity.    

**DNS log files** - View queries in general and to bad IPs, and block or modify bad request.     

**Authentication log files** - Know who logged in, brute-force attacks, and correlate with other logs.     

**Dump files** - Taking an application and dump the logs in memory into a file. We can use this to troubleshoot issues.     

**VoIP and call manager logs** - Viewing in and outbound call information. Get security information such as authentications and SIP traffic logs. These logs can be used to alert unusual country codes.
