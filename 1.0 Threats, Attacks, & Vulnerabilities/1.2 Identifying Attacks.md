# 1.2 Identifying Types of Attacks
## Viruses & Worms
**Virus** - a type of malware that can reproduce itself. It also needs the user to click on or open the virus/program to execute it. This is what's different between a virus and a worm. Anti-virus is a very common way to stop viruses form spreading.
**Virus Types** 
- Program: part of an application
- Boot sector: exist in the boot sector. 
- Script: OS or browser based.
- Macro: running inside an app like MS Office.
- Fileless: stealthy, never saves itself on the system. It operates solely n memory. This can be done with links that downloads and uploads a payload into RAM. They can even upload it to the registry
	
**Worm** - type of malware that self-replicates and self-propagate without any user interaction needed. They take advantage of networks to move across computers. Firewalls and IDS/IPS can mitigate many worm infestations. (**i.e. Wannacry**)

## Ransomware & Crypto-malware
Data is invaluable to a person or a company. **Ransomware** is a popular malware that claims the victims data and ask for a ransom money in return. 

**Crypto-malware** is a new generation of ransomware that encrypts your data and ask for ransom money so that your data is truly unavailable.

Prevention methods
- Backup your data!
- Keep offline backups
- Keep your system up-to-date
- Keep your anti-malware up to date

## Trojan & RATs
**Trojan horses** are a type of malware that pretends to be something else to try and get the victim and the victim's system to click on it or trust it. It can 

**PUP (Potentially Unwanted Program)** - potentially undesirable software. Often installed along with other software. Usually found by anti-malware. Types:
- Browser toolbar
- Search Engines
- Backups that use ads

**Backdoors** - Trojans like to open backdoors to easily reconnect to your system later. Not only trojans can use backdoors. 

**RATs (Remote Adminstration Tool)** - ultimate backdoor that allows attacker to remotely control and execute commands on a victims system. It can install keyloggers, watch your webcam, copy files and more.
Preventions: 
- Don't run programs you don't know
- Use anti-virus
- Backup your system
- Keep your system up to date

## Rootkits
Originally a Unix technique, this type of malware modifies core system files that the kernel uses. This makes it invisible. 

This is basically installing malware into the kernel to make it hardware to remove or detect.

Secure boot in UEFI usually prevents rootkits being installed.

## Spyware
**Adware** is malware that infects your computer using pop-ups with pop-ups of advertisements. This may also effect your system performance. This can be installed on accident. 

**Spyware** is malware that spies on you, gathering information to perform fraud, social engineering attacks etc. Often this is in the form of a Trojan horse.
Information gathered by spyware can include.
- Passwords
- Usernames
- Other sensitive information

## Bots & Botnets
**Bots** are th result of malware that takes over your computer to then make the computer act like a *robot* to the attackers advantage. 

**Botnets** are groups of bots that report to a C&C (Command & Control) server which gives the botnet instructions. Botnets can be used for various attacks including..
- DDoS: Distributed Denial or service attacks.
- Relays for spam, network traffic etc.
- Rented out to other attackers to be used to their liking.

Stopping a botnet - 
- OS and app updates
- Anti-malware
- Block at firewall
- Network monitoring

## Logic bomb
Type of attack that occurs when a separate event is triggered. They are commonly left by someone with a grudge like a fired employee or disgruntled activist who hates the organization. 

Logic bombs can go off when...
- A date or time is reached
- A particular user event occurs

It is difficult to identify logic bombs because each is unique and has it's own signature. You can use process and procedures to prevent logic bombs getting onto a system.

## Password Attacks
Attackers love **plaintext passwords** never ever store passwords as plaintext because that can then be accessed by an attacker and used maliciously.

Store passwords as a **hash**. You know what a hash is. There is usually a password file 

- **Spraying attack** tries to use multiple common passwords before moving on to a different username to avoid getting locked out.
- **Brute force** tries every combination of characters to find a password. Usually scripted or not done because online logins won't let you brute force.
- **Dictionary attack** uses common words to try and guess the password using words from our dictionary.
- **Rainbow tables** are tables of hash set to lookup instead of performing a hash over and over again. This increases speed.
- **Salting** is adding little bit of extra random data put into the password before it is hashed to make it more secure. This makes password attacks a lot harder.
- Use [haveibeenpwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) to check if you've been breached.

## Physical Attacks
- Malicious USB cables or thumb drives.
- Don't trust any devices you don't trust.

A USB can act as a **HID (Human interface device)/keyboard** to start a command prompt and do whatever it wants.

They can also load malware onto your computer.

- **Skimming** is stealing credit card information during a normal transaction from the cards magnetic strip. Usually ATM skimming. Can also use a camera to perform skimming.
	- Card number
	- Exp date
	- Card holder name
- **Card cloning** can also be achieved after skimming by copying a victims card magnetic strip information to a new card that looks and feels legit.

## Adversarial Artificial Intelligence
Using **machine learning** takes a lot of data to learn things like traffic and face recognition. We can use this to stop spam, recommend ads, and prevent car accidents.

**Poisoning training data** - is an attack vector that modifies the training data of the AI to behave incorrectly. (e.i Tay from Microsoft AI)

**Evasion attacks** can circumvent the machine learning to get spam and other malicious content around the AI. Or the attacker can use the AI against themselves and get information they couldn't get usually, from the AI.

## Supply Chain Attacks
This is attack any point in the supply chain to attack the target. Prevention methods:
- Smaller vendor base.
- Strict polices and procedures in place with vendors.
- Limited access control on the vendor.

## Cloud-based vs. On-Premise Attacks
- Cloud
	- Costs less
	- Centralized
	- Maintained for you
	- Less control
- On-site
	- Bigger burden
	- Cost more
	- Complete control

On-premise security
- Customize your security posture
- On-site IT team can manage security better
- Local team maintains uptime and  availability
- Security changes can take time

On-cloud security
- Data is in a secure environment
	- 3rd party may have access to data
- ICPs manage large-scale security
	- Users must follow security practices.
- Limited downtime
- Scalable security options

## Cryptographic attacks
Attacks in which attackers find shortcomings or flaws in cryptographic algorithms used in data transfer or data storage to gain access to that encrypted data.

It's usually the way the cryptography is implemented that results in an attack, not the cryptographic method itself

- **Birthday Attack** - using hash collisions to find inconsistencies in the hashing systems to find a password. Fix this by using a bigger hash like SHA-256.
	- MD5 has hash collisions
- **Downgrade attack** - is convincing something like MD5 or SSL 3.0 is perfectly fine when in reality they are not and can be taken advantage of.
