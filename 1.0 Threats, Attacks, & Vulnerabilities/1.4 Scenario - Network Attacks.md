# Given a scenario, analyze potential indicators associated with network attacks
## Evil Twin
An evil twin refers to a rogue Wireless Access Point (WAP) set up for eavesdropping or stealing sensitive user data. 

Evil twin replaces the legitimate access point and by advertising its own presence with the same Service Set Identifier (SSID, a.k.a. network name) appears as a legitimate access point to connecting hosts.

## Bluejacking and Bluesnarfing
**Bluejacking** is sending an unsolicited message to a victim device through Bluetooth. 
- Typically attacker needs to be within range
- Can send messages as well as other media
- Relatively low-priority, low risk security concern

**Bluesnarfing** is when an attacker can **access** data on a victim device using Bluetooth. This security weakness was patched soon after it was found in 2003 and is not much of a threat nowadays with Bluetooth clients.  

## Wireless Disassociation Attacks
Sometimes called a **wireless deauthentication attack**, this is a type of DoS attack and Deauthentication attack that kicks devices off of a wireless connection. 

- 802.11 wireless includes a number of management frames
	- Frames that make everything work
	- Front users never see these.
- These management functions are very important
- Previously 802.11 did not use encrypted or authenticated. 

- IEEE made changes to the 802.11 standard to...
	- Make important information encrypted
	- 802.11w is required for 802.11ac compliance


## Wireless Jamming
**Radio frequency jamming (RF)**
- DoS preventing wireless communication
- Transmit interfering wireless signals
	- Decrease the signal-to-noise ratio at the receiving device
	- The receiving device can't hear the good signal
- This jamming may or may not be intentional

Many different techniques can be used to achieve this.
- Constant, random bits
- Sending random or legitimate frames at random times
- Reactive jamming, limiting certain devices when they connect
- The jamming device needs to be **close**.
	- You can use a directional antenna, attenuator to look for jammers


## RFID and NFC Attacks
**RFID (Radio-frequency identification)** is technology used to identify pets, inventory or anything someone wants to track. Some of them can be as small as a grain of rice.
- Some RFID are one or bi-directional 
- These can be used to perform **replay** attacks or view **communication** over wireless. You might be able to **spoof** this as well.
- DoS is also an attack vector
- Many decryption keys for RFIDs are on the internet.

**NFC (Near field communication)** is a type of RFID technology that enables communication between devices like a credit card chip and other payment methods. 
- NFC also helps with Bluetooth pairing
- ID cards

Security concerns
- Remote capture - 10 meters for active devices
- DoS of the communication
- Relay / Replay attack as an on-path attack
- Loss/theft of RFC device


## Randomizing Cryptography
Randomization is key in cryptography so that we make sure we scramble our data well enough so that an attack cannot decrypt it.

**Cryptographic nonce** is an arbitrary number that is used one time. 
- "For the nonce" - for the time being
- A random or pseudo-random number
- Often used in a login process
	- Server gives nonce
	- Calculate password hash using nonce
	- This increases security, each nonce is unique
- **Initialization Vector** are used in encryption methods such as SSL and WEP.
- **Salt** - using a different salt for each user on a system.


## On-Path Attacks
An attacker that sits in the middle between two hosts, intercepting or changing data over the transmission.  This is an on-path attack, formerly called **man-in-the-middle** attack.

This can happen without the victim being aware. A common type of on=path attack is an **ARP poisoning (spoofing) attack**. This is a *Layer 2* attack.
- This is a local network attack 
- ARP does not have security (encryption or authentication)

If the attacker cannot get on the local network, they can perform an: 
- **On-path browser attack**. 
- This uses malware/Trojan as a proxy on the victims machine.
- Formerly called man-in-browser attack
- This has many advantages for the attackers


## MAC Flooding and Cloning
MAC - Media Access Control / Physical Address
LAN switching - 
- Forwards or drops frames
- Updates MAC address list/table
- Maintain a loop-free environment
	- Using Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)

**MAC Flooding** - attackers flood switches with traffic from different MAC addresses to fill up the MAC address table.
- Switch will stop directing frames properly
- Switch turns into a hub. No intelligence
- All frames are sent everywhere
- Attackers can easily capture all network traffic
Most switches have flood guard to prevent this.

**MAC Cloning/Spoofing** - attackers modifying their MAC address to match the MAC address of an existing attack.
- They can then circumvent filters
- Create DoS attacks
- Easy to manipulate MAC address through software 
Many switches include preventative measures for this.


## DNS Attacks
**DNS Poisoning** - 
- Takes a bit of knowledge, but very effective.
- How to
	- Modify client hosts file (like /etc/hosts)
	- Send a fake response to a valid DNS request

**DNS Spoofing** - 
- Same ARP spoofing. 

**Domain hijacking** - 
- Get access to the domain registration and you have control where the traffic flows
- Ways to get into an account can be 
	- Brute force
	- Phishing
	- Usual password cracking techniques

**URL hijacking** - 
- Using similar URLs for trying to get victims to the wrong site.
- Attackers can also buy the incorrect URL just to sell it to the owner.
- Commonly used for phishing opportunities.
- Can also redirect to a competitors website
- URL redirection is a characteristic of pharming.

**Types of URL hijacking** 
- Typo-squatting / brand-jacking - taking advantage of poor spelling
	- Outright misspelling
	- Typing error
	- Different phrasing
	- Different top-level domain (org, net, com)

Domain reputation
- Email reputation
	- If a site sends spam
	- Malware on the server/network
- Infected systems are noticed by the search engines. They can be flagged or removed
	- Uses will avoid this website


## Denial of Service
This is causing a service to fail
- Takes advantage of design failure or vulnerability
- Reasons
	- Competition 
	- Smokescreen for a different incoming attack
- These aren't that complicated, even pulling the power on a service is simple and effective.

A friendly DoS
- Network DoS
	- Layer 2 loop without STP
- Bandwidth DoS
- Water line break

 **DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) Attack**
 Attackers use botnets or an army of computers to use all the bandwidth on your network. these botnets also have a C&C (Command & Control) that control them all.
 - Asymmetric threat 
	 - Attacker may have fewer resources than the victim. 
- The most common type of DDoS is a **network-based DDoD**

**DDoS Amplifacation**
Way to take a small attack and amplify it.
- Common techniques
	- Using internet services against the victim
	- Use protocol with little to none authentication (DNS, NTP, ICMP)

**Application DoS**
Breaking an application or making it work hard to increase downtime and cost.
Examples
- ZIP bomb (Fill the disk space)
- Overuse cloud resources
	- When cloud resources increase they have to pay for it.
- Slow down cloud server response time

**Operational Technology (OT) DoS**
This is a DoS attack on hardware like industrial equipment such as
- Power grids
- Traffic control
- Manufacturing plants or nuclear plants
These can be serious problems.
This also requires a different approach then software.


## Malicious Scripts
**Powershell** scripts have a .ps1 extension.  This is a perfection target for attackers since this controls systems administration, AD administration, and file share access.

**Python** is also well-known for scripting.
- Common in cloud base applications
- This can be used to attack a broad base since it works on all OS's

**Shell script** is used for scripting in Unix/Linux shells. Off-shoots include
- Bash, Zsh, Csh, Dash, Fish, etc.
- These scripts also start with shebangs!

**Macros** are scripts with a specific to applications which are designed to make automation available within the application

**Visual Basic for Applications (VBA)** is Microsoft's automation process for their suite of applications. It is power and interacts with the operating system.
