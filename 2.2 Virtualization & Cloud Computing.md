# Summarize virtualization and cloud computing concepts

## Cloud Models
**Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)** - Sometimes called hardware as a service. A Service providing hardware and equipment. (e.g. web server provider)
**Software as a service (SaaS)** - On-demand software, just login and go. (e.g. Google Mail)
**Platform as a service (PaaS)** - No servers or software, they provide a platform for developing applications. Providing the building blocks. (e.g. Salesforce)
**Anything as a Service (XaaS)** - Broad description of any service over all cloud models. Flexible consumption model. 

**Cloud models**
- On Premises - everything is in house
- IaaS - everything but networking, storage, servers, and virtualization is in house
- PaaS - everything but the app and data is in cloud
- SaaS - everything is in the cloud

**Cloud service providers** - provide cloud services
- Charge a flat fee or use based
- Still manage internal staff, dev team, ops support
**Managed Service Providers (MSP)**
- Also maybe cloud provider
- Provide network connectivity management
- Backups and disaster recovery
- Growth management and planning
**Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP)**
- Firewall & patch management, emergency response, security audits

**On-premises vs off-premises**
- On-prem - everything is in our building
- Off-prem - located in third party location

**Cloud deployment models**
- Public - available to everyone
- Community - several orgs share the same resources
- Private - internal in your own data center
- Hybrid - a mix of public and private, consist of two or more interlinked cloud infrustructures


## Edge & Fog Computing
Cloud computing gives massive storage and processing power.
- Fast implementation for small cost
- Not always the best solution
	- Latency, limited bandwidth, difficult to protect data, requires internet

**Edge computing**
- Everything is processed local
- Or "Edge" - Process application data on an edge server, close to the user
**Fog computing** 
- A cloud that's close to your data (Cloud + IoT)
- Fog computing - distributed cloud architecture
- Distribute the data and processing
	- Data stays local, more private, faster


## Designing the Cloud
- On-demand computing power
- Elasticity - scale up or down
- App scale - access from anywhere

**Thin client** 
- Basic application usage.
	- Apps run on remote server
	- Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI), Desktop as a Service (DaaS)
- Minimal OS on client
- Network connectivity

**Virtualization**
- Allows running many operating system on the same hardware
- **Hypervisor** manages virtual machine connection to hardware.
- This is rather expensive due to CPU power, RAM, etc.
- A **snapshot** is a file-based capture of the state of a VM.

**Application containerization**
- Container
	- Contains everything you need to run an application
	- Code & dependencies
	- An isolated process in a sandbox - self-contained
- Container image - enables portability 
**Virtual vs Container** - Virtual uses many OS instead of one and requires hypervisor.

**Micro-services and APIs**
- Monolithic applications - one big app that does everything
- API - Application programming interface
- Scalable and resilient. Also more security and compliance.

**Serverless architecture**
- Function as a Service (FaaS) - apps separated into functions, removing the OS.
- May be event triggered and ephemeral(temporary)
- Managed by a third-party

**Transit gateway** 
- Virtual Private Cloud (**VPC**) - pool of resources in a containers
- Common to create many VPCs
- Transit gateway is a router to the cloud
	- Usually connected to via VPN

**Resource policies**
- Assigning permissions to cloud resources 

**Service integration** 
- Service Integration and Management (**SIAM**)
- Many different service provider due to **mulitsourcing**
- Every provider work differently


## Infrastructure as Code
- Being able to describe application instances as code and then using that to deploy the instance.

**SDN (Software Defined Networking)**
- Networking devices have two functional planes of operation
	- Control plane and data plane
- Directly programmable
	- Configuration is different than forwarding
- Agile - changes can be made dynamically
- Centrally managed - global view
- Programmatically configured
- Open standards

**SDV (Software Defined Visibility)**
- Allows us to deploy security devices while understanding data flow between system. Includes
	- SIEM, Firewalls, web app firewalls
- Data is encapsulated and encrypted
	- **VXLAN (Virtual Extensible LAN)** and SSL/TLS
- If we id a threat 


## Cloud Standardization Organizations
**Security policy organizations**
- **CASB (Cloud Access Security Broker)** - a security policy enforcement software tool or service placed between cloud service users and cloud applications.
- **CSA (Cloud Security Alliance)** - nonprofit organization promoting best practices related to cloud computing environments
- **CCM (Cloud Controls Matrix)** - cybersecurity control framework for cloud computing


## Virtualization Security 
**VM sprawl avoidance**
- Click a button and buid a server, network, firewall, etc
- Sprawl is when you get too many VMs and don't deprovision them accordingly and they get out of hand.
- Have a process of provisioning an instance and deprovisioning it.

**VM escape protection** 
- The VM self-contained
- **Virtual machine escape** - exploit breaking out of a VM to another VM
	- This would be a huge exploit
