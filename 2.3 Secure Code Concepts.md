# Summarize secure application development, deployment, and automation concepts

## Secure Deployments
**Development to production**
- How to deploy a new application safely and reliably
- Manage these processes

**Sandboxing** - Isolated testing environment
- No connection to the real world or production system
- Use during development process

**Building the application**
- Development
	- Secure environment
	- Writing code
	- Developers test in their sandboxers
- Test
	- Still in development stage
	- Does it all work
- Quality Assurance (QA)
	- Verifies feature are working as expected
	- Verify old error don't reappear
- Staging
	- Almost ready to roll it out
	- Works like the real world environment
	- Test usability and features
- Production
	- Rolled out to the user community

**Secure baselines** - the security of an application environment should be well defined.
- All application instances must follow this baseline
- Firewall settings, patch levels, OS file versions
- May require constant updates
- Integrity measurements check for the secure baseline


## Provisioning & Deprovisioning
**Provisioning** - deploying an application, server, database, etc and ensuring software and network security.

**Scalability and elasticity** - handling application workload
- Scalability - the ability to increase the workload in a given infrastructure
	- Build an app instance that can handle 100,000 transactions per second
- Elasticity - increase or decrease available resources as the workload changes
	- Deploy multiple application instances to handle 500,000 transactions per second

**Orchestration**
- Automation is the key to cloud computing - services appear and disappear automatically, or at a switch
- Entire application instances can be instantly provisioned (servers, networks, etc.)
- Instances can move around the world as needed
- **Security policies** should be part of the orchestration

**Deprovisioning** - removing the application instance
- Security deprovisioning is important
- Firewall policies must be reverted
- You have to decide what happens to the data


## Secure Coding Techniques
**Stored procedures**
- SQL databases - to be really secure, only use stored procedures (queries)

**Obfuscation/camouflage**
- Make something hard to understand
- Take application code and make it difficult to read.
- Helps prevent reverse engineering

**Code reuse/dead code**
- Old code could have security vulnerabilities
- Dead code is code that does nothing. This can introduce vulnerabilities

**Input validation**
- Check through input data
- **Normalization** is checking and correcting all input
- **Fuzzers** will find what you missed

**Validation points**
- Server-side validation - checks input on server
- Client-side validation - faster, checkers input on client
- Use both, but server-side is better

**Memory management**
- Never trust data input
- Buffer overflow are a huge security risk

**Third-party libraries and SDKs**
- These may still be insecure, like Log4j
- Balance application features vs. unknown code base

**Data exposure**
- Data may be very sensitive
- Make sure we encrypt our data in our programming

**Version control (git)**
- System to track code, revert, branch etc
- Useful for security - identify modifications to important files
- A security challenge - code history can be a risk


## Software Diversity
Creating software (programs/binaries) that is different on everyone's computers. Therefore binaries are different and are less likely to be exploited.

## Automation & Scripting
- Plan for change - implement automatically
- Automated courses of actions for problems
- Configuration validation

**Continuous integration (CI)**
- When code is constantly written, this opens up more chances for vulnerabilities
- Use automation to do security checks during development
- Large-scale security analysis during testing

**Continuous delivery/deployment (CD)**
- Continuous delivery
	- Automate the testing and release process
	- Click a button and deploy the application
- Continuous deployment 
	- Even more automation
	- Deploy to production automatically
	- No human integration
