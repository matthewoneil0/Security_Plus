# Summarize the techniques used in security assessments

## Threat hunting
Strategies are constantly changing, it is a cat and mouse game. Intelligence data  is reactive, you can't see the attack until it happens. 

**Intelligence fusion** - an overwhelming amount of security data makes it hard to parse, specify and understand.
	- Many data types are dramatically different in type and scope
	- Separate teams work together to handle this.
		- Security operations, security intelligence, threat response
	- Fuse this data together and use analytics to achieve intelligence fusion

**Fusing data**
- Collecting data (logs, network info, internet events, intrusion detection)
- Add external sources (threat feeds, government alerts, social media, etc)
- Correlate with big data analytics to focus on predictive analysis and user behavior analytics.

**Cybersecurity maneuvers** 
- Firewall rule, block IP's, delete malware
- Automated maneuvers are used to automates deployments or maneuvers
- Combine this with fused intel


## Vulnerability Scans
- Usually minimally invasive, this is not a pen-test
- Port scan (Nmap, Masscan)
- Identify systems
- Test from the outside and inside
- Gather as much intel as possible (recon)

**Scan types**
- Non-intrusive scans - recon only, no exploiting
- Intrusive scan - pentest
- Non-credential scans - scanning with creds to the network
- Credentialed scan - normal user scanning (insider attack)

**Identify vulnerabilities**
- Scanner looks for everything
- Application scans - desktop and mobile apps
- Web applications - software on a web server
- Network scans - misconfigured firewalls, open ports, vulnerable devices

**Vulnerability research**
- National Vulnerability Database (NVD)
- Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)
- MS Security Bulletins (vendor websites)
- Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

**Vulnerability scan log review**
- Lack of security controls (No firewall, anti-virus, anti-spyware)
- Misconfigurations (Open shares, guest access)
- Real vulnerabilities (new ones, old ones)

**Dealing with false positives**
- Scan doesn't get it right - false positives
- This is different that low severity vulns
- **False negatives** scan that get detect it
	- To avoid this make sure you run the latest signatures

**Configuration review** 
- Validate security of device config
- Workstation account configs
- Server permission config
- Security device configs


## Security Information and Event Management
**SIEM** - Security information and event management system
- Log collection of security alert
- Log aggregation and long-term storage
	- Includes advanced reporting features
- Data correlation
- Forensic analysis

**Syslog** - standard for message logging between different devices
- Usually a central log collector
- This requires a lot of disk space. It's a lot of logs

**SIEM data**
- Data inputs - VPN connections, firewall session logs, server authentication attempts, etc
- Packet captures - network packets

**SOC (Security Operations Center)** 
- Security monitoring
	- Constant information flow
	- Track important stats
	- Send alerts (via triggers)

**Security Reports** created by SIEM's
**Analyzing the data** - 
- Big data analytics
- User and entity behavior analytics (**UEBA**)
- Sentiment analysis - public opinion is taken into account

**SOAR (Security orchestration, automation, and response)** 
- Automate routine, tedious, repetitive task
- Orchestration
	- Connect tools like firewalls, account managers, email filters
- Automation
	- Handle security tasks automatically
- Response
	- Responding immediately to events
