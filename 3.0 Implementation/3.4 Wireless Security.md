# Given a scenario, install and configure wireless security settings

## Wireless cryptography
**Securing a wireless network**
- Authenticate using usernames, passwords, MFA, etc.
- Ensure confidentiality using encryption
- Verify integrity using a message integrity check (**MIC**)

### Wireless encryption
**WPA2 and CCMP**
- **Wi-Fi Protected Access II (WPA2)**
	- WPA2 certification began in 2004
	- Uses CCMP block cipher mode or Counter Mode with Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol, or CBC-MAC Protocol
- CCMP security services offer
	- Confidentiality with AES
	- MIC (integrity) with CBC-MAC

**WPA3 and GCMP**
- V3 of WPA2, introduced in 2018
- Uses GCMP block cipher mode
	- Galois/Counter Mode Protocol, stronger than WPA2
- GCMP security services
	- Confidentiality with AES
	- MIC with Galois Message Authentication Code (GMAC)

**WPA PSK problem**
- Subject to brute-force by obtaining the hash of the key that is used in the 4-way handshake 
- With the hash, attackers can brute force the pre-shared key (PSK)
- Attackers can use GPUs, time, and cloud processing

**SAE**
- WPA3 changes PSK authentication process to include mutual authentication
- Creates a shared session key without sending that key across the network
- No more 4-way handshakes
- Includes perfect forward secrecy (session key is thrown away at the end)
- **Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE)**
	- Derived from Diffie-Hellman
	- Everyone has a different session key
	- This was added to the IEEE standard, referred to as the dragonfly handshake


## Wireless Authentication Methods
- Credentials
	- Shared password/ pre-shared key (PSK)
	- Centralized authentication (802.1X) for enterprise WiFi
- Configuration
	- Part of the wireless network connection
	- Prompted during connection

**Wireless security modes**
- Configure authentication on the WAP/router
- Open System - no password required
- WPA3-Personal / WPA3-PSK
	- Everyone uses the pre-shared key
	- Unique session key is derived from the PSK using SAE
- WPA3-Enterprise or -802.1X
	- Centralized authentication server

**Captive portal**
- Authentication that uses login prompt in your browser (portal)
- Ask for a username and password
- Like the one for University

**Using WPS**
- WiFi Protected Setup
	- Allows for easy setup for a mobile device
	- Allows different method such as a PIN, button, of NFC (near field comms)

**WPS hack**
- PIN is only 8 digits and can be brute forced
- WPS validates each half of the PIN is verified separately, splitting the brute force time in half
- This takes about 4 hours to go through every possible PIN
- Most devices have brute force prevention methods like time-outs
