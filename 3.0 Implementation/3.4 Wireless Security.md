# Given a scenario, install and configure wireless security settings

## Wireless cryptography
**Securing a wireless network**
- Authenticate using usernames, passwords, MFA, etc.
- Ensure confidentiality using encryption
- Verify integrity using a message integrity check (**MIC**)

### Wireless encryption
- **WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy)** - key is brute-force-able, therefore the protocol is now deprecated.
- **AES** is the least vulnerable cryptographic algorithm to attacks.

**WPA2**
- **Wi-Fi Protected Access II (WPA2)**
	- WPA2 certification began in 2004
	- Uses CCMP block cipher mode or Counter Mode with Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol, or CBC-MAC Protocol
- AES-CCMP security services offer
	- Confidentiality with AES
	- MIC (integrity) with CBC-MAC
- Personal mode uses PSK

**WPA3 (the best)**
- V3 of WPA2, introduced in 2018, takes advantage of AES-GCMP and AES-CCMP
- Uses GCMP block cipher mode
	- Galois/Counter Mode Protocol, stronger than WPA2
- GCMP provides confidentiality with AES and 
	- MIC with Galois Message Authentication Code (GMAC)
- Personal mode uses SAE
- Requires RADIUS authentication server

**WPA PSK problem**
- Subject to brute-force by obtaining the hash of the key that is used in the 4-way handshake 
- With the hash, attackers can brute force the pre-shared key (PSK)
- Attackers can use GPUs, time, and cloud processing

**SAE**
- WPA3 changes PSK authentication process to include mutual authentication
- Creates a shared session key without sending that key across the network
- No more 4-way handshakes
- Includes **perfect forward secrecy** (session key is thrown away at the end)
- **Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE)**
	- Derived from Diffie-Hellman
	- Everyone has a different session key
	- This was added to the IEEE standard, referred to as the dragonfly handshake


## Authentication Protocols
**Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)**  - a set of authentication frameworks for wireless networks. There are 5 different types of EAP adopted by WPA/WPA2 standard. We only need to be aware of two of them.  

- **LEAP (Lightweight EAP)** - Proprietary protocol by Cisco as a stop gap to WEP and lacked Windows support. 
	- Clear text transmissions
	- Since been deprecated 
- **PEAP (Protected EAP)** - Developed by Cisco, RSA, and MS
	- Uses digital certificates used on the authentication server
	- Established encrypted channel between client/server via TLS tunnel
- EAP-FAST (EAP-Flexible Authentication via Secure Tunnel (Cisco))

- **EAP-TLS** - Offers the highest level of security, considered the gold standard
	- Offers both client-side and server-side certificates for authentication

**IEEE 802.11X Wireless Protocols** - Wireless communication over 802.11 standard operating over 2.4 GHz and/or 5 GHz radio frequencies.  
- 802.11 - 1 or 2 Mbps - 2.4GHz
- 802.11a - 54 Mbps - 5GHz
- 802.11b - 11 Mbps - 2.4GHz
- 802.11g - 54 Mbps - 2.4GHz
- 802.11n - <=600 Mbps - Either
- 802.11ac - <= 1,300 Mbps - 5GHz
- 802.11ax (WiFi 6) - <= 14,000 Mbps - Either

**RADIUS Federation**   
- Connects a common system of authentication and credentials database
- Uses RADIUS servers to connect these system wirelessly
- Can be used by multiple applications/platforms


## Wireless Authentication Methods
- Credentials
	- Shared password/ pre-shared key (PSK)
	- Centralized authentication (802.1X) for enterprise WiFi
- Configuration
	- Part of the wireless network connection
	- Prompted during connection

**Wireless security modes**  
- Configure authentication on the WAP/router
- **Open System** - no password required
- **WPA3-Personal / WPA3-PSK**
	- Everyone uses the pre-shared key
	- Unique session key is derived from the PSK using SAE
- **WPA3-Enterprise or -802.1X**
	- Centralized authentication server

**Captive portal**  
- Authentication that uses login prompt in your browser (portal)
- Ask for a username and password
- Like the one for University

**Using WPS (WiFi Protected Setup)**  
- WiFi Protected Setup
	- Allows for easy setup for a mobile device
	- Allows different method such as a PIN, button, of NFC (near field comms)

**WPS hack**  
- PIN is only 8 digits and can be brute forced
- WPS validates each half of the PIN is verified separately, splitting the brute force time in half
- This takes about 4 hours to go through every possible PIN
- Most devices have brute force prevention methods like time-outs
- WPS is deprecated and should not be used


## Wireless Authentication Protocols
**Site surveys**
- Getting more information about the existing access points
- May need to work around frequencies
- Use **heat maps** to identify signal strengths

**Wireless survey tools**
- Use tools to find out 
	- Signal overage
	- Potential interference, etc
	- **WiFi analyzers**
	- **WAP power level controls**

**Wireless packet analysis**
- Doing this has to be quiet to where you can hear everything but no one can hear you
- Some network drivers won't capture a lot of info
- View wireless-specific information

**Channel selection and overlaps**
- Frequency conflicts can cause interference between WAPs. Make sure that WAP coverage that overlaps don't use the same frequency or you will have dead spots.
- Use automatic or manual configuration
- More GHz gives you more channels to work with
- This is why surveying is important

**Access point placement**
- Minimize overlap, and maximize coverage
- Avoid EMI, and physical interference
- Get them as close as possible to users
- Use **Omnidirectional antennas** that provide a 360-degree horizontal signal coverage. Also a common standard for APs for indoor WLAN deployments.

**Wireless infrastructure security**
- Wireless controllers
	- Centralized management of WAPs
	- Secure these using HTTPS, control access, and time-out functions
- Secure access points
	- Use strong password, keep firmware updated
