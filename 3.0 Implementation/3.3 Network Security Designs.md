# Given a scenario, implement secure network designs

## Load Balancing
A way to distribute a load between multiple devices
- Multiple web servers can be used to balance traffic loads between them
- This also provides fault tolerance

- The load balancer can also be used to
	- TCP offload (doing it for the server)
	- SSL offload
	- Cache data
	- Prioritization
	- Content switching

- **Round-robin** - each server is selected in turn (hence round robin)
	- Weighted round-robin - can shift weight of load to specific server
	- Dynamic rr - monitor and distribute load accordingly
- **Affinity** - kinship between the client and server
	- Makes sure the client keeps communication with the same server
- **Active/passive mode**
	- Some servers are active and some are passive so that if a server fails a passive one takes its place


## Network Segmentation
Physical, logical, or virtual segmentation. It is common to segment for...  
- Performance 
- Security
- Compliance with standards and laws

- **Physical segmentation** - also known as an **air gap** where devices are simply physically separated
- **Logical segmentation** - using VLANs to virtually separate devices
- **Screened subnet** - or DMZ, provides a network for incoming traffic to avoid traffic coming straight into the internal network
- **Extranet** - separate network for vendors, suppliers, and partners, basically a screened subnet but with more permissions
- **Intranet** - network only accessible through the internal network, a network in the network
- **East-west traffic** - data flows in a data center between devices
- **North-south traffic** - data flows in and out of the data center
	- These can also be seen as "lateral" and "vertical"
- **Zero trust** - holistic approach to network security 
	- Covers every devices, process, and person
	- Use MFA, encryption, permissions, firewalls, monitoring, etc.


## Virtual Private Networks
- VPN - encrypted data traversing a public network
- **Concentrator** - device that encrypts and decrypts data 
- VPN Clients connect to the concentrator which connects you to the VPN network

- **SSL VPN (Secure Sockets Layer VPN)** - Uses SSL/TLS on TCP port 443
	- Can be ran in browser (very lightweight)
- **HTML5 VPNs** - using a SSL VPN client in a web browser using APIs for cryptography
	- This allows us to create a VPN tunnel without a separate VPN application
	- You have to have an HTML5 compliant browser, which is most

**Types of VPN connections**
- **Full tunnel** - everything is sent to the VPN concentrator going across the encrypted tunnel
- **Split tunnel** - some information goes through the encrypted tunnel and some doesn't, the VPN admin configures this
- **Site-to-site VPN** - concentrator to concentrator connections that are almost always on
- **L2TP (Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol)**
	- Used for site2site
	- Connects sites over L3 network as if they were connected at L2
	- Commonly implemented with IPsec (L2TP for the tunnel and IPsec for the encryption)
		- AKA - L2TP over IPsec

- **IPsec (Internet Protocol Security)**
	- Security for L3 (network layer)
	- Provides encryption and packet signing (confidentially and integrity)
	- Read more in [[3.1 Secure Protocols]] (transport and tunnel mode)


## Network access control (NAC)
Fill this in

## Port Security
Here we are talking about physical connections to ports on switches and routers, not TCP/UPD ports.  

**Broadcast** (packets sent to everyone)
- Broadcast have a scope of its broadcast domain
- Routing updates and ARP requests use broadcast
- IPv6 has no broadcast (multi-case instead)

**Broadcast storm control** 
- Switches can control broadcast and often multicast and unicast
	- Maybe manage by specific values or by percentage

**Loop protection**
- Connecting two switches, making a loop, that ends up looping data which can bring down a network.
- **STP (Spanning tree protocol)** - used to prevent loops in networks
- **BPDU guard (Bridge Protocol Data Unit)** - the STP control protocol to constantly watch interfaces for BPDU frames

**DHCP snooping** - IP tracking on L2 (switch)
- Switch snoops DHCP conversations for untrusted interfaces

**MAC filtering** - manage traffic based on MAC address on packet
- However, MAC addresses can be spoofed using free and open-source software
- MAC filtering is seen as security through obscurity


## Secure Networking
**Domain name resolution**
- DNSSEC - adds the ability to confirm origin authentication and data integrity
	- Uses public key cryptography to sign DNS records
- Block malicious domains using **sinkhole addresses**, replacing bad site IPs with sinkhole addresses.
	- Also monitor devices who try to access these bad domains

**Out-of-band management**
- Using separate management interfaces to connect to and manage devices
- Large environments use comm servers or console routers to centralize out-of-band access for multiple devices
	- This way you can connect to the console router and go from there

**The need for QoS** 
**QoS** - Quality of Service
- Managing different devices and their needs to manage traffic priority and importance
- Judge traffic prioritization based on maximum bandwidth, traffic rate, VLAN, etc.

**IPv6 security is different**
- IPv6 allows many more IP addresses, this makes port scanner harder, but not impossible
- Therefore we don't need NAT (Network address translation)
- This also nerf attacks such as ARP spoofing
- However new attack are potential e.g. Neighbor Cache Exhaustion

**Taps and port mirrors**
- Intercept network traffic using taps
- Physical taps are placed in the middle of traffic
- Port mirrors is often software based, used for port redirection

**Monitoring services**
- Services that constantly monitoring the network
- Staff members may be at the SoC
- IR included along with compliance

**FIM (File Integrity Monitoring)**
- Monitoring files that should not change
- Windows has SFC (System File Checker)
- Linux has Tripwire


## Firewalls
Firewalls allow us to control to flow of traffic going through, into, and out off our network. This can include content filtering, anti-malware, etc.

**Network-based firewall** 
- Filters traffic by port number or application
- Encrypt traffic 
- Commonly replaces routers (L3/network) including NAT and routing functions

**Stateless firewall**
- Doesn't keep track of traffic flows
- This style of firewall is older and not really used anymore
	- Rule based like iptables on Linux (only an ACL table)

**Stateful firewall** 
- This is most firewalls, much more secure on a network
- Uses ACLs (Access Control List) and a Session table that work together to direct traffic

**UTM / All-in-one security appliance**
- This is a **Unified Threat Management** / Web security gateway
- Can URL and spam filter, routing and switching, firewalling, IDS/IPS, VPN endpoints and more

**Next-generation firewall (NGFW)**
- Application layer gateways that can inspect deep into packets, seeing where they are going port, host, and application, and can see application use
- Also include IPS systems
- Content filters by category and URLs

**Web application firewall**
- Applies rules based on HTTP(S) traffic/conversations
- It can allow/deny based on expected input, this can prevent SQL injections, XSS, and other web exploitation techniques
- A major focus of **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)**

**Firewall rules**
- **Access control lists (ACL)** - provides list of rules to firewall to conduct traffic
- Rule variables AKA tuples such as Source/Destination IP/port, time-of-day
- **Implicit deny** - if traffic doesn't match any rules, we deny it

**Firewall characteristics**
- Open-source vs. proprietary
	- Open-source - usually provides only traditional functions
	- Proprietary - includes application control and high-speed hardware
- Hardware vs. software
	- Hardware can be efficient and flexible 
	- Software-based can be installed almost anywhere
- Appliance vs. host-based vs. virtual
	- Appliance provides the fastest throughput
	- Host-based can be application aware and view plaintext data
	- Virtual can provide valuable East/West network security (through a data center)


## Network Access Control
**Edge vs. access control**
- Control at the edge
	- Managed by rules and those rules are rarely changed
- Access control
	- Control access using multiple attributes based on
		- User, group, location, inside/outside, application
	- These rules can change dramatically over time

**Posture assessment**
- Can't trust everyone's device in a BYOD environment
	- Unauthorized applications and malware pose a threat
- Before connecting to a network, perform a heath check or posture assessment to clear the device before connecting it to the network
- Use **Persistent agents** which stays installed on end devices that you update
- Or a **Dissolvable agent** which doesn't install but rather runs the assessment and terminates when no longer needed
- **Agentless NAC** can make checks during login and logoff events

**Failing your assessment**
- When a user fails do not allow to the network
- Use a quarantine network and notify admins to try and get the device to be cleared


## Proxy Servers
A device that sits between users and the rest of the network
- Useful for caching information, access control, and firewall functions
- **Explicit** proxy is a proxy that applications may need to know how to use
- **Transparent** proxies are invisible

**Applicatino proxies**
- e.g. NAT
- Most proxies in use are application proxies
- These kind may only support HTTP(S), FTP, etc

**Forward proxy**
- Used to control user access to the internet, aka an internal proxy

**Reverse proxy**
- Between inbound traffic to our network/server, literally the opposite of a forward proxy

**Open proxy**
- A 3rd party, uncontrolled proxy
- Called open because they live on the internet for anyone to use
- This is a big security concern


## Intrusion Prevention
Intrusion Detection/Prevention System watches a block incoming attacks on the network
- IDS - alarm
- IPS - actively blocks attacks

**Passive monitoring**
- Examining a copy of the network traffic using a port mirror or network tap
- There's no way here to block/prevent traffic
**Out-of-band response**
- When malicious traffic is identified IPS sends TCP RST (reset) frames, disabling subsequent traffic flows, however the first packet gets through
**Inline monitoring**
- More common where the IDS/IPS sits physically inline where all traffic passes through the IDS/IPS
**In-band response**
- Able to block traffic in real time so that nothing gets inside the network

**Identification technologies**
- Signature-based - looks for traffic matching known malware signatures
- Anomaly-based - using AI to look for abnormal traffic
- Behavior-based - observing what attacks look like and reporting/blocking it
- Heuristics - using AI and machine learning to id attacks


## Other Network Appliances
**Jump server** 
- Allows us to access internal devices through a single, hardened device
- We can use SSH or any remote protocol to access servers on the private network
- So from the outside we'd connect to the jump server and "jump" to another server on the private network
- However, a compromised jump server is very bad

**Hardware Security Module (HSM)**
- Device that is designed to control keys and certificates in your environment
- Used in large environments in clusters with redundant power
- High-end cryptographic hardware
- Key backup in secured storage
- Can also be used as a cryptographic accelerator to offload CPU overhead from other devices

**Sensors and collectors**
- Used to aggregate info from network devices
	- Integrated with switches, routers, servers, firewalls, etc.
- **Sensors** sense data logs from IPS logs, firewalls logs, etc. 
- **Collectors** collect the logs from the sensors and display them
	- Many SIEMs include sensors and collectors
