# Given a scenario, implement secure protocols

## Secure Protocols
 **Voice and video**
 - **SRTP** - Secure Real-Time Transport Protocol / Secure RTP
 - This adds security features to keep convos private
 - Encryption through AES 
 - Offers authentication, integrity, and replay protection through HMAC-SHA1 hashed based mesage authentication code (using SHA1)

**Time synchronization**
- OG NTP (Network time protocol)  doesn't have any security features
- Use **NTPSec**! - Secure Network Time Protocol

**Email**  
- **S/MIME** - Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions
   - Public key encryption and digital signing. Requires a PKI or similar org of keys.  

- **SMTPS** - deprecated TLS-based method for securing SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)

- **Secure POP and Secure IMAP**
	- **POP3** - used for sending messages
	- **IMAP** - Offers improved functionality compared to POP3 as well as serving the same function
	- Use a STARTTLS extension to encrypt POP3 w/ SSL or use IMAP w/ SSL
	- **POP3S** - secure POP3 using SSL/TLS on TCP port 995
	- **Secure IMAP** - uses SSL/TLS on TCP port 993

- **SSL/TLS**
	- If the mail is browser based, always encrypt with TLS/SSl

**Web**
- **SSL/TLS** - Secure Socket Layer/Transport Layer Security
- **HTTPS** - Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure/SSL(TLS)
	- This protocol also enables remote access to another computer via a web browser
- These you public key encryption where the private key is on the server
	- Symmetric session key is transferred using asymmetric encryption
	- Provides security and speed


**IPsec (Internet Protocol Security)**
- Security at OSI Layer 3 (network layer)
- Provides confidentiality and integrity/anti-replay
- 2 core protocols - **Authentication Header (AH) & Encapsulation Security Payload (ESP)**
	- **AH** - provides authentication and integrity
	- **ESP** - provides authentication, integrity, and confidentiality
- **Tunnel mode** - provides entire packet encryption (most common)
- **Transport mode** - provides payload encryption (the data part of the packet)

**File transfer**
- **FTPS** - FTP over SSL
- **SFTP** - SSH File Transfer Protocol
	- Provides additional management functionality

**LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)**
- For reading and writing directories over an IP network
- Specs written by Telecommunications Union (TU)
- e.g. Active Directory, OpenLDAP, Apple OpenDirectory, etc.
- **LDAPS (LDAP Secure/SSL)** - LDAP over SSL
- **SASL (Simple Authentication & Security Layer)** - Provides authenication using many different methods, i.e. Kerberos or client certificatate

**Remote Access** 
- **SSH** - Secure Shell - replaces Telnet with encryption - allows remote shell access

**Domain name resolution**
- **DNS** had no security in the OG design
- **DNSSEC** - Domain Name System Security Extensions
	- Provide authentication, data integrity, and validation
	- We use public key cryptography 
		- DNS records are signed with a trusted 3rd party
		- Signed DNS records are published in DNS

**Routing and switching**
- SSH
- **SNMPv1&2** - offers authentication based on community strings sent in an unencrypted form. (old, not in use anymore)
	- Offers authentication, but not confidentiality or integrity
- **SNMPv3 (Simple Network Management Protocol version 3)** - used to query routers and switches for information.
	- Provides confidentiality, integrity, and authentication
- **HTTPS** - Browser-based management

**Network address allocation**
- **DHCP** does not come with security
- **DHCP snooping** - a security feature of a network switch that provides countermeasures against rogue DHCP servers is called
- **Rogue DHCP servers** - In AD, DHCP servers have to be authorized

- Some switches can be configured to only trust specific DHCP servers
- **DHCP client DoS** - Starvation attack
	- Uses spoofed MAC addresses to exhaust the DHCP pool

**Subscription services**
- Automated subscriptions
	- Anti-virus, IPS updates, Firewall and signatures updates
	- Constant updates are a must
	- Check for encryption and integrity
