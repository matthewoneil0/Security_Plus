# Summarize the basics of cryptographic concepts

## Cryptography Concepts
**Cryptanalysis** - the art of cracking encryption  
**Keys** - key used to encrypt plaintext into ciphertext  
**Key stretching/strengthening** - making a weak key strong by performing multiple  processes like hashing repeatedly.  
**Key stretching libraries** - **bcrypt** uses Blowfish cipher to do rounds of hashing  
**Password-based Key Derivation Function 2 (PBKDF2)** - part of RSA public key cryptography standards  

**Lightweight cryptography**
- Since IoT devices are limited
- Led by NIST
	- Provide solid cryptography for not  a lot of power

**Homomorphic encryption (HE)**
- Encrypted data is difficult to work with
- With HE you can perform calculations of data while it's encrypted
- Securely store data in the cloud


## Symmetric and Asymmetric Cryptography
**Symmetric**
- One key to encrypt and decrypt data (symmetric)
- If the key gets out, you're out of luck
- AKA Secret key algorithm or **Secret-key encryption**
- Doesn't scale very well. Hard to distribute
- Less overhead and resources than asymmetric

**Asymmetric**
- Multiple keys AKA public key cryptography
- Private key - only you have access to
- Public key - key you give to everyone, can be public
- Encrypt with one key and decrypt with the other (this can be vice versa)

- **Key generation**
	- Build both keys at the same time
	- Lots of randomization with large prime numbers

**Symmetric key from asymmetric key**
- Use public and private key to create a symmetric key
- e.g. Alice and Bob give their own public keys to each other and use their own private keys with the public keys to make symmetric keys.
- This is Diffie-Hellman

**Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)**
- Instead of numbers, use curves!
- Uses smaller keys than other asymmetric encryption
- Smaller storage and transmission requirements
- Perfect for mobile devices


## Hashing and Digital Signatures
**Hashes** - represent data as a short string of text, kinda like a fingerprint   
**One-way trip** - it's impossible to undo a hash to get the data, this makes it great to store passwords   
**Integrity** - we can use hashing to compare hashes to verify integrity
This can be a digital signature.   
**Collision** - when hashes are equally but their input is different   
**Hash functions** - checksum, message digest   
**MD5 collision** - found in 1996, now we don't use MD5   

**Practical hashing**
- Verify a downloaded file
- Uses hashes for password storage
- **Salting** - adding random data to a password to change to hash
	- This makes rainbow tables pointless, however this doesn't stop RE

**Digital signatures** 
	- Provide integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation
	- Prove the message was not changed along with the source and if it is fake
	- Sign with the private key
	- Verify with public key
**Creating a digital signature**
- Hashing the plaintext and then using the senders private key, they encrypt the hash to create a digital signature.
**Verify a digital signature**
- Decrypt using the public key of the sender, then compare the hash from the digital signature with the hash of the plaintext.


## Cryptographic Keys
**Key strength**
- Longer key is always better
- For symmetric encryption, 128-bit+ are common
- For asymmetric, 3,072 bits+ are common

**Key exchange**
- How to transfer a key over an insecure channel
- Out-of-band key exchange - transferring a key outside of the network
- In-band exchange - transferring over the network using more encryption

**Ephemeral key** - a key that isn't permanent, often changed

**Traditional web server encryption**
- SSL/TLS uses encryption keys to protect web server communication
- Based on it's RSA key pair
- This can provide one point of failure

**Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)** - Changes the encryption process so that you're not using the same private key repeatedly
- Uses elliptic curve or DH ephemeral
- Each session has a different private key
	- Session keys are symmetric and only used during one session
- This requires more overhead however
- The browser must support PFS


## Steganography
**Obfuscation** - making data difficult to understand
- Code obfuscation
- Stegonography
- SSID broadcast suppression

**Steganography** - storing data in an image
**The covertext** - the container file (.png, .jpeg, etc.)

**Common stego techniques**
- Network-based - embded message in TCP packets
- Images - embed the message in the image
- Invisible watermarks
- Audio files
- Video files as well


## Quantum Computing
Computing based on quantum physics
- New computing technology
- Instead of bits, it uses qubits, which can be in three states

This could
- Search quickly through large databases

**Post-quantum cryptography**
- Breaks our existing encryption mechanisms
- Shor's algorithm proves this
- **NTRU**
	- Uses a "closest-vector" problem
- We will need options for the future 

**Quantum communication**
- Protect against eavesdropping using quantum cryptography - Quantum Key Distribution (QKB)
- This is because if someone monitors the qubits then they change and the data is unreadable.


## Stream and Block Ciphers
**Stream ciphers** - encrypts one byte/bit at a time, high speed, low hardware complexity
- Used with symmetric encryption

**Block ciphers** - encrypts fixed-length groups at a time
- Use symmetric encryption
- Mode of operation - different ways to use block ciphers
	- **ECB (Electronic Codebook)** - each block is encrypted with the same key, this is most common.
	- **CBC (Cipher Block Chaining)** - each block is XOR'd with the previous block, the IV (initialization vector) is used for the first block.
	- **CTR (Counter)** - encrypts counter and then XOR's is with the plaintext to create the ciphertext, then increment counter and do it to the next block

- **GCM (Galois/Counter Mode)** - encryption with authentication (uses counter mode block cipher)
	- This provides integrity and confidentiality

- **RSA** - common symmetric cipher
- **AES** - common asymmetric cipher


## Blockchain Technology
**Blockchain** - Distributed ledger where everyone on the blockchain network maintains the ledger. This provides checks and balances.


## Cryptography Use Cases
- Lower power devices can use **ECC** for asymmetric encryption
- Low latency - fast computing time using symmetric encryption
- High resiliency - use hashing for data integrity
- Confidentiality - secrecy and privacy
- Integrity - using hashing like I just said two lines above
- Obfuscation - modern malware can use this to get through firewalls
- Authentication - password hashing, and adding salt
- Non-Repudiation - confirming sender, a digital signature e.g.


## Cryptography Limitations
- Different platforms use different cryptographic options
- You HAVE to implement it right for cryptography to work
- Every situation is different
- Limitations -
	- Speed, power (overhead)
	- Size (encrypted data takes up more storage e.g. padding)
	- Weak keys (key size or IV (initialization vector))
	- Time (takes time to hash/encrypt)
	- Longevity (brute-forcing is easier as faster hardware comes out)
	- Predictability and entropy (randomization, cannot be predicted)
	- Key reuse (key can get compromised)
	- Resources vs. security constraints (IoT devices, delay, maintenance)
