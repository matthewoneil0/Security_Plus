# Explain the security implications of embedded and specialized systems

## Embedded Systems
An embedded system is hardware or software that is built for a specific purpose.
- Special hardware or cost
- e.g. traffic light controllers, digital watches, medical imaging system

**SoC (System on a Chip)**
- Multiple components running on a single ship are common
- Small form-factor 
	- External interface support, flash/cache memory
- Security considerations
	- Difficult to upgrade hardware
	- Limited OTS (off the shelf) security options

**FPGA (Field-programmable gate array)**
- Integrated circuit you can programs on after manufacturing
- Common in firewalls, routers, etc

**SCADA (Supervisory Control & Data Acquisition System) / ICS**
- Multi-site Industrial Control Systems (ICS)
- PC manages equipment 
	- Power generation, refining, industrial equipment
- Distributed control systems
	- Real-time information
	- System control
- Requires extensive segmentation - no access from the outside

**Smart devices / IoT** 
- Sensors - lighting or AC
- Smart devices - alexa, google home, etc
- Wearable - watch or monitor
- Facility automation - temperature, etc
- Weak defaults - IOT makers are not made by security professionals

**Specialize IoT devices**
- Medical devices - insulin pumps, heart monitors
- Vehicles - connected to the internet
- Aircraft - DoS could damage aircraft
- Smart meters - measure power & water usage

**VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol)**
- Replaced Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS)
- A relatively complex embedded system, each device is a computer

**HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning)**
- PC manages equipment
- Traditionally not built with security in mind

**Drones**
- Flying vehicle becoming more common
- May be manually controlled or flown by AI
- Extensive commercial and non-commercial use
	- May require federal licenses
	- Security and fail-safes are required

**Multifunction Devices (MFD) (printers, scanners, and fax machines)**
- Some image are stored locally on device
- Logs are stored on the device

**RTOS (Real-Time Operating System)**
- An OS with a deterministic processing schedule
	- No time to wait for other processes
	- Think of OS in cars where breaking needs to be fast
- Extremely sensitive to security issues
	- Non-trivial systems
	- Difficult to know what security is in place

**Surveillance systems**
- Video/audio surveillance
- Secure the security system
	- Restrict access from others
	- Prevent DoS
- Hard to physically replace cameras
	- Accessible independently over the network
	- May allow for firmware upgrades 


## Embedded Systems Communication
**5G (fifth gen cellular networking)**
- Significant performance improvements
	- Broadcast at higher frequencies to get fast speeds
	- Eventually reach speeds of 10 g/s
	- Common speed though are around 100-900 Mbit/s
- Large impact on IoT devices
	- Devices will be less constraint
	- Have larger data transfers

**SIM (Subscriber identity module)**
(SIM car like  in your phone)
- Universal integrated circuit card
- Used to provide info to cellular network provider (phones, tablets, embedded sys)
- Contain mobile details - IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity)
	- Also authentication, and contact details
- Important to manage

**Narrowband**
- Allowing communication over a very narrow range of frequencies
- This results in more power so the signal can be sent over a larger distance
- Many IoT devices can use this to communicate over long distances
	- SCADA equipment
	- Sensors in oil fields

**Baseband**
- Using a single frequency to communicate, usually over a single cable (fiber or copper)
- The communication uses all the bandwidth on the wire
- Bidirectional communication is possible but it's usually only communicating one way
- Ethernet standard - 100BASE-TX, 1000BASE-T, 10GBASE-T

**Zigbee**
- IEEE 802.15.4 PAN standard for IoT networking
- Alternative to WiFi or Bluetooth
	- Longer distances with less power consumption
- This allows a mesh network of all Zigbee devices in your home
	- Light switch communicates to light bulbs
	- Tell Amazon Echo to lock the door
- Uses the ISM (Industrial, Scientific, and Medical) band
	- 900 MHz and 2.4 GHz frequencies in the US


## Embedded Systems Constraints
- ES's are usually on a device that isn't a fully capable computer
	- Low cost, purpose-built
- Adds additional constraints
	- May have limited features
	- Upgrade limits
	- Limits in communication options
- This the trade-off for using embedded devices
	- Low cost but built for something specific
	- Unique management challenges also arise

**Constraints**
- Power - may not have useful accessible power, batteries may need replacing
- Compute - low-power CPUs are limited
- Network - options for wired link (may be in a field) and wireless is the limiting factor
- Crypto - limited hardware options, difficult to change or modify cryptographic features
- Inability to patch - upgrades can be limited or difficult to install
- Authentication - security is often an afterthought, limited options for authentication
- Range - range of purpose is small, these are purpose-built and not for intended for anything else
- Cost - low cost may affect product quality (think lifespan)
- Implied trust - limited access to OS and security posture
