# Given a scenario, implement cybersecurity resilience.

## Disk Redundancy
**Redundancy** - duplicating parts of a system so the redundant part can be used if failure happens

**Geographic dispersal** - disperse technologies to different places so if disasters happen (Tornado, Flooding, etc.) you have a backup away from it.

**Mulitpath I/O (Input/Output)**
- Allows us to create other routes on the network so that if one fails the other one kicks in.
**RAID** 
- **Redundant Array of Independent Disk**
- Using multiple drives create redundancy

RAID0 - no backups - High performance, no fault tolerance
RAID1 - Mirroring - Use duplicate backups, re
RAID5 - Split information between drives (striping with parity)
Other RAID levels - combine RAID methods to increase redundancy


## Network Redundancy
- **Load balancing** - balances traffic load between servers, if an active server fails, the passive server takes its place.
- **NIC teaming** (Load balancing / fail over (LBFO)) - using with NICs on a device, this allows us to use these connections to split traffic between NICs and also have a redundant NIC if one fails.
	- Mulitple network adapters - look like a single adapter, integrate with switches
	- NICs talk to each other - usually over mulitcast connection
	- **Port aggregation** - aggregating traffic for data across a network


## Power Redundancy
- **UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply)** 
	- Short-term backup power (uses batteries)
	- Blackout, brownouts, surges
- UPS types
	- Offline/Standby, Line-interactive, On-line/Double-conversation
- Features - auto-shutdown, battery capacity, outlets, phone line suppression

- **Generators** 
	- Long-term power backup (fuel)
	- May take a few minutes to get up to speed

- **Dual-power supplies**
	- Multiple internal and external power supplies provide redundancy
	- Each power supply can handle 100% of load
	- Often hot-swappable

- **Power distribution units (PDUs)**
	- Provides multiple power outlets (usually in a rack)
	- Often includes monitoring and control


## Replication
- **SAN(Storage Area Network) replication** - Specialized high-performance network of storage devices.
- SAN-to-SAN replication - Duplicate data centers 
- SAN snapshot - Create a state of data based on a point in time and then copy that to other SANs
- **VM replication** - replicate updates, maintain copies of VMs (just files) anywhere in the world. Recover the VM from your replicant.
- **On prem vs. cloud**
	- Speed - local is more fast
	- Money - local is more costly
	- Security - local is more private


## Backup Types
- Archive bit/attribute - a bit that is turned on when I file is modified
- Full backup - save everything
- Incremental - all files that have changes since last incremental backup
- Differential - all files that have changes since last full backup

**Full backup** - High backup time / low restore time
**Incremental backup** - Low backup time / high restore time
- Full backup first 
- Subsequent backups 
- If backup needed, do full backup and all subsequent backups
**Differential backup** - Moderate backup time / restore time
- Full backup first
- Differential backup (backup everything that's changed since full backup)
- Recover, do full backup and the differential backup

**Backup media**
- Magnetic tape - sequential, easy storage, can be large
- Disk - faster then magnetic, deduplicate & compress (more efficient)
- Copy - may not include versioning, 

**NAS vs. SAN**
- Network Attached Storage (NAS)
	- Connect to a shared device across the network
- Storage Area Network (SAN
	- Looks like local storage, block-level access
	- Very efficient reading and writing
- This requires a lot of bandwidth

**Other backups**
- Cloud - maybe limited bandwidth, multiple devices
- Image - replica of whole OS, file system etc.
**Backup locations**
- Offline backup - local, fast, and secure. usually offsite
- Online backup - accessible, remote, encrypted(safe), limited speed.


## Resiliency
**Non-persistence** - changing services and instances
- Snapshots can capture configs and data
- Live boot media

**High availability (HA)** - backups are always on and immediately available.
- May include many different components working together
- This may be costly (paying for firewalls, routers, switches, wiring)

**Order of restoration** - order for an application needs to be restored
- Restore bottom layers (like a pyramid) / dependencies, before top layers

 **Diversity** - when vulnerabilities come out, if you have diverse technology, it will only effect a subset of your tech.
 - Multiple security devices
 - Also diversify vendors
 - Cryptographic - diverse certificate authorities can provide additional protection. 
 - Controls - Admin, technical, physical controls. This allows defense-in-depth
