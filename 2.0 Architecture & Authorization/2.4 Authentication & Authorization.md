# Summarize authentication and authorization design concepts

## Authentication Methods
**Directory services** - central db that stores users, passess, printers, etc
- Distributed across multiple devices
- Each user only needs one set of credentials
- e.g. Active Directory, Kerberos or LDAP

**Federation**
- Way to allow some to authenticate to your network using credentials from a third-party
- Third-parties can establish a federated network
- e.g. loggin in with Facebook or Google on another site

**Attestation** 
- Way to prove the hardware is really yours (company hardware)
- When we have thousands of devices, this is useful to automate
- Remote attestation
	- Device provides an operational report to a verification server
	- Encrypted and digitally signed with the TPM (Trusted Platform Module)
	- An IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity Number) can be included in the report

**Short message service (SMS/text)**
- Login factor can be sent via SMS (code)
- Way to provide MFA
- Security issues exit (phone # can be changed, or sms can be intercepted)

**Push notifications**
- Similar to SMS notification - pushed to a specialized app
- Security concerns - application pushing notification could be vulnerable

**Authentication apps**
- Pseudo-random token generators
- Physical or digital token generator

**TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password algorithm)**
- Use a secret key and the time of day
- Secret key is configured ahead of time
	- Timestamps are synced via NTP
- Often to put in user, pass, and TOTP code

**HOTP (HMAC-based One-Time Password algorithm)**
- Token used once and never used again
- Token-based authentication (user, pass, code)

**Phone call**
- A voice call provides the token
- Similar to SMS security issues

**Static codes**
- Like PIN codes for debit cards

**Smart card**
- e.g. chip in credit card, id badge


## Biometrics
Something you are.
- Fingerprint scanner
- Retinal scanner
- Iris scanner
- Voice recognition
- Facial recognition
- Gait analysis (walk type)
- Veins/Vascular scanners

**Acceptance rate**
- False acceptance rate (FAR) - likelihood that an unauthorized user will be accepted
- False rejection rate (FRR) - likelihood that an authorized user will be rejected
- Crossover error rate (CER) - defines accuracy. 
	- Rate at which FAR and FRR are equal


## Multi-factor Authentication
**AAA framework**  (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting)
- Identification
	- This is approving who you say you are (username)
- Authentication
	- Proving you are who you say you are (password)
- Authorization
	- Based on id and auth, what access do you have
- Accounting
	- Keeping track of all the above

**Cloud vs. on-premises authentication**
- Cloud-based security
	- Third-party can manage the platform, centralized
	- Automation options with API integration
- On-prem authentication system
	- Internal staff, expertise

- **Multi-factor authentication**
	- Factors (Something you know, have, and are)
	- Attributes (Somewhere you are, something you can do or exhibit, or someone you know)

- Something you know - Password, PIN, Pattern
- Something you have - smart card, USB token, Hardware or software tokens, phone
- Something you are - biometric (print, voice, face)

- Somewhere you are - provides a factor based on your location, IP address, GPS
- Something you can do - signature, similar to biometrics, 
- Something you exhibit - gait analysis, typing analysis
- Someone you know - digital signature
