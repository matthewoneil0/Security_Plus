# Given a scenario, implement host or application security solutions
## Endpoint Protection
This will cover protection at the endpoint level as in device end-points. We use Defense-in-Depth.
- **Anti-virus and anti-malware** - stops malware attacks
- **Endpoint detection and response (EDR)** - uses multiple mechanisms to detect malware through behavioral analysis, machine learning, and process monitoring
	- Can often perform root cause analysis and respond to it by removing it or isolating it.
- **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)** - design to stop and prevent data leakage at rest, transit, or in use. DLPs can be in the cloud or on endpoints
- **Next-generation firewall (NGFW)** - identifies and manages application communication over the network.
	- Also called Application layer gateway, Stateful multi-layer inspection, and Deep packet inspection
	- Provides broad security controls way beyond blocking traffic from an IP on your network
- **Host-based firewall** - is software that runs on endpoints, working like a firewall on the endpoint level
	- Common to manage these centrally
- **Host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS)** - detects intrusion into a host; a firewall can be used to block the detected traffic.
- **Host-based Intrusion Prevention System (HIPS)** - actively recognizes and block known attacks.
	- Uses signatures, heuristics, and behavioral identification
	- Identifies buffer overflows, registry updates, and writing files, etc.
	- Since it's on an endpoint, it has access to plaintext data


## Boot Integrity
The boot process is the perfect place the infect a system using an attack like a rootkit.  
Protecting the boot process is important. Here we look at  
- Secure boot, trusted boot, and measured boot

**Hardware root of trust** - Security is based on trust
- **Trusted Platform Module (TPM)**, **Hardware Security Module (HSM)**
- These are used to establish trust

**Trusted Platform Module (TPM)** - A specification for cryptographic functions
- May include Cryptographic processor
- Persistent memory for keys
- Versatile memory - store keys, hardware configuration, etc.
- The TPM is password protected

**UEFI BIOS Secure Boot**
- Secure boot - part of UEFI BIOS
	- BIOS includes manufacturer's public key
	- Digital signature is checked during a BIOS update
- Secure Boot verifies the bootloader
	- Checks digital signature
	- Bootloader must be signed with a trusted certificate or manually approved

**Trusted Boot process**
- Bootloader now verifies the digital signature of the OS kernel.
- Then verifies other parts of the OS
- Then just before loading drivers it launches **ELAM (Early Launch Anti-Malware)** which starts checking drivers

**Measured Boot process**
- Process that allows us to measure if any changes have occurred to the OS.
- Uses hashing to verify OS components.
- **Remote attestation** 
	- Device provides an operational report to a verification server
	- This report is encrypted and signed with the TPM
	- Once the server receives it, if there is something wrong the server admins will take a look at it and determines what to do.


## Database Security
- Compliance Issues
	- PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR

**Practices**  
- **Tokenization** - replace sensitive data with a non-sensitive placeholder
	- Common with credit card numbers to store temp card numbers or tokens
	- This isn't hashing or encryption so there's no overhead
- **Hashing** passwords - stores the data as the hash of the data and not the plaintext data
- **Salting** - adding information to the hash input


## Application Security
Secure code concepts are a balance between time and quality.  
Programming with security in mind is often secondary.  
- Testing - Quality Assurance (**QA**)

- **Input validation** - document every input vectors on a product, e.g. normalization, fuzzing

- **Dynamic Analysis** (Fuzzing) - sending random input into a program to break the program and look for errors to look for vulnerabilities
	- Takes time and power
	- Carnegie Mellon Computer Emergency Response Team (**CERT**)
		- CERT Basic Fuzzing Framework (BFF)

- **Secure cookies** - information stored on your browser
	- Used for tracking session management
	- Secure cookies have a Secure attribute
	- But don't put PII into these cookies

- **HTTP Secure Headers** - way to configure a web server to be secure
	- e.g. enforcing HTTPS communication, prevent XSS
	
- **Code signing** - developer digitally signs the application code
	- Uses asymmetric encryption
	- A trusted CA signs the dev's public key
	- Dev signs the code with their private key

- **Allow/Deny list** - management security policy to control app execution
	- e.g. allow only application's hash that match a hash stored, only be able to run applications on your PATH, enforce network zones

- **Static code analyzers**
	- Static Application Security Testing (**SAST**) - Helps identify flaws and vulnerabilities in source code.
	- These analyzers do miss some things and show false positives


## Application Hardening
Application Hardening - minimize attack surface, remove vulnerabilities, etc.  

**Resources**
- Center for Internet Security (CIS)
- Network and Security Institute (SANS)
- National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)

**Open ports and services** 
- Every port is a possible attack vector
- Can be managed with a firewall
- Use Nmap to analyse ports

**Registry**
- Common to use 3rd party tools to see registry modifications made by applications
- Some registry changes are important security settings (configure registry settings, disable SMBv1)

**Disk encryption**
- Full Disk encryption (**FDE**) - encrypt everything on the drive
- Self-encrypting drive (**SED**) - hardware-based FDE
	- No OS software needed
- **Opal storage specification** - standard for SED storage

**OS hardening**
- Update your OS
- Harden user accounts (passwords, permissions)
- Network access and security (limited network access)
- Monitor (anti-virus, anti-malware)

**Patch management**
- Monthly OS, drive, and application updates (Windows update, apt update)
- Auto-update (not always the best option, test updates first)
- Emerency out-of-band updates (0day events)

**Sandboxing**
- Limits application scope
- Usually done in software production
- Used in 
	- VM's
	- Mobile devices
	- Browser iframes
	- Windows User Account Control (UAC)
