# Explain the importance of physical security controls

## Physical Security Controls
**Barricades / bollards**
- Prevent access
- Channel people through access point
- Identify safety concerns

**Access control vestibule**
- All doors normally unlocked
- All doors are normally locked
- One door open / other doors lock
- This is managed 

**Alarms**
- Circuit-based - doors, windows, fence
- Motion detection - inf
- Duress - "red button" panik button

**Signs**
- Saftey, danger, fire exit signs, etc

**Video surveillance**
- CCTV (Closed circuit television)
- Camera features
	- Motion recognition
	- Object detection
- Often many cameras are used and networked together

**Industrial camouflage**
- Concealing an important facility in plain sight, blending in with the local environment
- Protect a data center
	- No business signs or visual clues

**Guards and access lists**
- Security guards
- ID badge that must be worn at all times
- Access lists - list of permissions
- Maintain a visitor log
- Two-person integrity/control - No single person has access to a physical asset
- Robot sentries for monitoring, this is an emerging technology

**Biometrics**
- Biometric authentication 
- Stores a mathematical representation of your biometric
- Hard to duplicate
- Used in very specific situations

**Door access controls**
- Lock and key
- Deadbolt
- Electronic lock
- Token-based lock
- Cable locks - usually temporary locks that work almost anywhere

**USB data blocker**
- A cable that connects from a USB device to a computer that does not connect to the data wires on the device.
- Use your own power adapter to avoid 

**Proper lighting**
- More light means more security
	- Attackers avoid lights
	- Non IR cameras can see
- Specialized design
	- Avoid shadows and glare

**Fencing**
- Build a perimeter
	- Usually very obvious, may be too obvious 
- Transparent or opaque

**Fire suppression**
- Water is generally a bad thing around electronics
- Detection - smoke, flame, or heat detector
- Suppress with water when okay
- Suppress with chemicals when you can't use water
	- Commonly with Dupont FM-200

**Sensors**
- Motion detection
- Noise detection
- Proximity reader
- Moisture detection
- Temperature (especially in a data center)

**Drones**
- Quickly cover large, hard to access areas
- Can be used for damage assessment or site surveys
- Some drones you video or sensors

**Faraday Cage**
- Blocks electromagnetic fields (Discovered by Michael Faraday in 1836)
- Made of a conductive material 
- Not a comprehensive solution (not all signals are blocked)
- Can restrict access to mobile networks (for say emergency calls)

**Screened subnet**
- Formerly known as a Demilitarized zone (DMZ)
- Additional layer between private network and the internet

**Protected distribution**
- Protected Distribution System (PDS)
	- A physically secure cabled network
- Protect your cables and fibers - All the data flows through these conduits
- Prevent cable/fiber taps - direct taps and inductive taps
- Prevent cable/fiber cuts (DoS)


## Secure Areas
- Physically secure the data - As important as digital security
- Part of security policy and operations
- Secure offline data like backups as well

**Air gap**
- Physical separation between networks
- Most environments are shared, but  some you need air gaps
	- e.g. SCADA, Power systems, stock market networks, Airplanes, etc

**Vaults & safes**
- Vault - secure, reinforced room, onsite
- Safe - small vault, less expensive

**Hot and cold aisles**
- Data centers have lots of equipment and heat
- Optimize cooling
- But also conserve energy because it can be costly
	- Focus the cooling using hot aisles and cold aisles


## Secure Data Destruction
**Data destruction and media sanitation policies**
- Disposal becomes a legal issue
- You don't want to throw out critical information, try physically destroying them
- Maybe reuse the storage media

**Protect your trash**
- Secure your garbage - fence and a lock
- Shred your documents
- Burn documents
- Pulps the paper - removing the ink and recycling the paper

**Physically destruction**
- Shredder or pulverize
- Drill or hammer
- Electromagnetic (degaussing)
- Incineration

**Certificate of destruction**
- Destruction is often done by a 3rd party
	- Cert confirms they destroyed everything

**Sanitize media**
- Purge data from database or storage
- Wipe data - unrecoverable removal, usually overwrites the storage, useful when reusing drives

**Data security**
- File level overwriting
	- Sdelete
- Whole drive deletion
	- DBAN - Darik's Boot and Nuke
- Physical drive destruction
	- Sure fire way
