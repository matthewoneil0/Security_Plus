# Explain the techniques used in penetration testing

## Penetration Testing
This is simulating an attack. Trying to exploit any vulnerabilities on your network/system. 

**Rules of engagement** - this is an important document that defines purpose and scope and makes everyone aware of the test parameters.
- Type of testing and schedule
- The rules
	- Scope
	- Emergency contacts
	- How to handle sensitive information

**Working knowledge** - how much do you know about the test.
- Unknown environment
- Known environment
- Mix of both

**Exploiting vulnerabilities** - trying to break into the system. 
- Be careful, this can cause DoS or data loss
- Gain privilege escalation
- Use different techniques
	- Social engineering
	- Password brute-force
	- Injections, etc

**The process** 
- Initial exploitation - get into network
- Lateral movement - move from system to system
- Persistence - setup backdoor, user accounts, etc
- The pivot - gain access to one system that leads(pivots) to another

**Aftermath**
- Cleanup - remove temp files and backdoors, delete created accounts, and leave network how you found it.
- Bug Bounty - reward for discovering vulnerabilities


## Reconnaissance
Gathering information about the system you are going to attack.
- Creating network maps
- Understand security posture
- Minimizing the attack area

**Passive footprinting** - using open source intelligence to gather information.
- Social media, Reddit
- Corporate website
- Social Engineering
- Dumpster Diving
- Business Organization

**Wardriving or Warflying** - combining WiFi monitoring and GPS location to find where a wireless network might be, access points, and SID names. This is driving or flying a drone to do this. [Wigle](https://wigle.net/)

**Active footprinting** - Trying the doors
- Ping, port, and service scans
- DNS queries
- OS fingerprinting


## Security Teams
- Ops security, Pen-testing, Exploit research, Hardening
- Teams
	- Red Team - offensive, pen-testing team. Ethical hacking
	- Blue Team - defensive, protecting from the red team. Incident response, threat hunting, operational security, digital forensics.
	- Purple Team - makes sure red and blue team work together. This could also just be a combined red and blue team.
	- White Team - Not a side, oversees everything. Manager or referees in security exercises.
