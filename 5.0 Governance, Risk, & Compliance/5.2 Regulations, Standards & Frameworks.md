**PCI DSS** - Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard - A standard for protecting credit cards.     
- 6 control objectives
	- Build and maintain a secure network and systems
	- Protect cardholder data
	- Maintain a vulnerability management program
	- Implement strong AC measures
	- Regulatory monitor and test networks
	- Maintain an information security policy


## Security Frameworks
**Center for Internet Security (CIS)** - Designed to help orgs improve security posture with different recommendations for different organizations.    

**NIST RMF** - National Institute of Standards and Technology Risk Management Framework (RMF). Six step process
1. Categorize environment
2. Select appropriate controls
3. Implement controls
4. Assess if controls are working
5. Authorize a system
6. Monitor for continuous compliance

**NIST CSF** - NIST Cybersecurity Framework - A voluntary commercial framework. Including    
- Framework Core
- Framework Implementation Tiers
- Framework Profile

**ISO/IEC frameworks** - International Org for Standardization / International Electrotechincal Commission.    
- ISO/IEC 27001 - Standard for an Info Sec Mgmnt System (ISMS)

## Secure Configurations
**Web server hardening** - harden permissions, manage banner information, and disabling directory browsing. Including SSL for certificates, and monitoring logs.   

**OS hardening** - Updates, passwords and permissions, network access, and constant monitoring.    

**Application server hardening** - OS updates, permissions, and access controls.    

**Network Infrastructure Devices** - Switches, routers, firewalls, IPS, etc.     
- Configure authentication, security updates from the vendors
