# Given a scenario, implement secure network designs

## Load Balancing
A way to distribute a load between multiple devices
- Multiple web servers can be used to balance traffic loads between them
- This also provides fault tolerance

- The load balancer can also be used to
	- TCP offload (doing it for the server)
	- SSL offload
	- Cache data
	- Prioritization
	- Content switching

- **Round-robin** - each server is selected in turn (hence round robin)
	- Weighted round-robin - can shift weight of load to specific server
	- Dynamic rr - monitor and distribute load accordingly
- **Affinity** - kinship between the client and server
	- Makes sure the client keeps communication with the same server
- **Active/passive mode**
	- Some servers are active and some are passive so that if a server fails a passive one takes its place


## Network Segmentation
Physical, logical, or virtual segmentation. It is common to segment for...  
- Performance 
- Security
- Compliance with standards and laws

- **Physical segmentation** - also known as an **air gap** where devices are simply physically separated
- **Logical segmentation** - using VLANs to virtually separate devices
- **Screened subnet** - or DMZ, provides a network for incoming traffic to avoid traffic coming straight into the internal network
- **Extranet** - separate network for vendors, suppliers, and partners, basically a screened subnet but with more permissions
- **Intranet** - network only accessible through the internal network, a network in the network
- **East-west traffic** - data flows in a data center between devices
- **North-south traffic** - data flows in and out of the data center
	- These can also be seen as "lateral" and "vertical"
- **Zero trust** - holistic approach to network security 
	- Covers every devices, process, and person
	- Use MFA, encryption, permissions, firewalls, monitoring, etc.


## Virtual Private Networks
- VPN - encrypted data traversing a public network
- **Concentrator** - device that encrypts and decrypts data 
- VPN Clients connect to the concentrator which connects you to the VPN network

- **SSL VPN (Secure Sockets Layer VPN)** - Uses SSL/TLS on TCP port 443
	- Can be ran in browser (very lightweight)
- **HTML5 VPNs** - using a SSL VPN client in a web browser using APIs for cryptography
	- This allows us to create a VPN tunnel without a separate VPN application
	- You have to have an HTML5 compliant browser, which is most

**Types of VPN connections**
- **Full tunnel** - everything is sent to the VPN concentrator going across the encrypted tunnel
- **Split tunnel** - some information goes through the encrypted tunnel and some doesn't, the VPN admin configures this
- **Site-to-site VPN** - concentrator to concentrator connections that are almost always on
- **L2TP (Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol)**
	- Used for site2site
	- Connects sites over L3 network as if they were connected at L2
	- Commonly implemented with IPsec (L2TP for the tunnel and IPsec for the encryption)
		- AKA - L2TP over IPsec

- **IPsec (Internet Protocol Security)**
	- Security for L3 (network layer)
	- Provides encryption and packet signing (confidentially and integrity)
	- Read more in [[3.1 Secure Protocols]] (transport and tunnel mode)


## Port Security
Here we are talking about physical connections to ports on switches and routers, not TCP/UPD ports.  

**Broadcast** (packets sent to everyone)
- Broadcast have a scope of its broadcast domain
- Routing updates and ARP requests use broadcast
- IPv6 has no broadcast (multi-case instead)

**Broadcast storm control** 
- Switches can control broadcast and often multicast and unicast
	- Maybe manage by specific values or by percentage

**Loop protection**
- Connecting two switches, making a loop, that ends up looping data which can bring down a network.
- **STP (Spanning tree protocol)** - used to prevent loops in networks
- **BPDU guard (Bridge Protocol Data Unit)** - the STP control protocol to constantly watch interfaces for BPDU frames

**DHCP snooping** - IP tracking on L2 (switch)
- Switch snoops DHCP conversations for untrusted interfaces

**MAC filtering** - manage traffic based on MAC address on packet
- However, MAC addresses can be spoofed using free and open-source software
- MAC filtering is seen as security through obscurity


## Secure Networking
**Domain name resolution**
- DNSSEC - adds the ability to confirm origin authentication and data integrity
	- Uses public key cryptography to sign DNS records
- Block malicious domains using **sinkhole addresses**, replacing bad site IPs with sinkhole addresses.
	- Also monitor devices who try to access these bad domains

**Out-of-band management**
- Using separate management interfaces to connect to and manage devices
- Large environments use comm servers or console routers to centralize out-of-band access for multiple devices
	- This way you can connect to the console router and go from there

**The need for QoS** 
**QoS** - Quality of Service
- Managing different devices and their needs to manage traffic priority and importance
- Judge traffic prioritization based on maximum bandwidth, traffic rate, VLAN, etc.

**IPv6 security is different**
- IPv6 allows many more IP addresses, this makes port scanner harder, but not impossible
- Therefore we don't need NAT (Network address translation)
- This also nerf attacks such as ARP spoofing
- However new attack are potential e.g. Neighbor Cache Exhaustion

**Taps and port mirrors**
- Intercept network traffic using taps
- Physical taps are placed in the middle of traffic
- Port mirrors is often software based, used for port redirection

**Monitoring services**
- Services that constantly monitoring the network
- Staff members may be at the SoC
- IR included along with compliance

**FIM (File Integrity Monitoring)**
- Monitoring files that should not change
- Windows has SFC (System File Checker)
- Linux has Tripwire


## Firewalls
