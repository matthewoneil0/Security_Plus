# Given a scenario, implement secure network designs

## Load Balancing
A way to distribute a load between multiple devices
- Multiple web servers can be used to balance traffic loads between them
- This also provides fault tolerance

- The load balancer can also be used to
	- TCP offload (doing it for the server)
	- SSL offload
	- Cache data
	- Prioritization
	- Content switching

- **Round-robin** - each server is selected in turn (hence round robin)
	- Weighted round-robin - can shift weight of load to specific server
	- Dynamic rr - monitor and distribute load accordingly
- **Affinity** - kinship between the client and server
	- Makes sure the client keeps communication with the same server
- **Active/passive mode**
	- Some servers are active and some are passive so that if a server fails a passive one takes its place


## Network Segmentation
Physical, logical, or virtual segmentation. It is common to segment for...  
- Performance 
- Security
- Compliance with standards and laws

- **Physical segmentation** - also known as an **air gap** where devices are simply physically separated
- **Logical segmentation** - using VLANs to virtually separate devices
- **Screened subnet** - or DMZ, provides a network for incoming traffic to avoid traffic coming straight into the internal network
- **Extranet** - separate network for vendors, suppliers, and partners, basically a screened subnet but with more permissions
- **Intranet** - network only accessible through the internal network, a network in the network
- **East-west traffic** - data flows in a data center between devices
- **North-south traffic** - data flows in and out of the data center
	- These can also be seen as "lateral" and "vertical"
- **Zero trust** - holistic approach to network security 
	- Covers every devices, process, and person
	- Use MFA, encryption, permissions, firewalls, monitoring, etc.


## Virtual Private Networks
- VPN - encrypted data traversing a public network
- **Concentrator** - device that encrypts and decrypts data 
- VPN Clients connect to the concentrator which connects you to the VPN network

- **SSL VPN (Secure Sockets Layer VPN)** - Uses SSL/TLS on TCP port 443
	- Can be ran in browser (very lightweight)
- **HTML5 VPNs** - using a SSL VPN client in a web browser using APIs for cryptography
	- This allows us to create a VPN tunnel without a separate VPN application
	- You have to have an HTML5 compliant browser, which is most

**Types of VPN connections**
- **Full tunnel** - everything is sent to the VPN concentrator going across the encrypted tunnel
- **Split tunnel** - some information goes through the encrypted tunnel and some doesn't, the VPN admin configures this
- **Site-to-site VPN** - concentrator to concentrator connections that are almost always on
- **L2TP (Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol)**
	- Used for site2site
	- Connects sites over L3 network as if they were connected at L2
	- Commonly implemented with IPsec (L2TP for the tunnel and IPsec for the encryption)
		- AKA - L2TP over IPsec
- **IPsec (Internet Protocol Security)**
	- Security for L3 (network layer)
	- Provides encryption and packet signing (confidentially and integrity)
	- Read more in [[3.1 Secure Protocols]] (transport and tunnel mode)
